        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> They use a vibrant color palette against a clean white background. Action buttons (like "Get started") use high-contrast colors like indigo to draw the eye immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site uses a consistent "slant" motif in its background sections and a unified set of custom icons that make the brand feel cohesive across different product pages.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are strictly snapped to a grid. Text is left-aligned for readability, while code snippets and graphics are perfectly balanced on the opposite side of the screen.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Grouping is handled through generous white space. Related features are kept in distinct "blocks," ensuring the user isn't overwhelmed by too much information at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Terrible. Brightly colored text, blinking GIFs, and low resolution images overlap, making it nearly impossible to find a focal point.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is no consistent theme; every ad uses different fonts, sizes, and colors, leading to a fragmented and overwhelming experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are scattered across the page like a collage, requiring horizontal and vertical scrolling to see everything.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Unrelated products are bunched together without sufficient white space, making it difficult to tell where one listing ends and another begins.</li>
